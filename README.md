# Simple Shell Project üöÄ

Welcome to the Simple Shell project, one of the most exciting and challenging projects that will test your programming skills and knowledge acquired so far at ALX SE.

## Project Overview üìö

### Basics Covered:
- Programming Fundamentals
- C Programming
- Engineering Thinking
- Group Work
- Learning How to Learn

### Important Reminder ‚ùó
Before diving into the project, make sure to review the [project framework](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559). Pay close attention to the rules, especially the prohibition against looking at other people's code.

### Project Specifics üìñ
The Simple Shell project involves creating a UNIX command-line interpreter. Here are some key points:

- Compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specified options.
- Ensure your code follows the Betty style.
- No memory leaks are allowed.
- Group project - work collaboratively with your partner.

## Learning Objectives üéì
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Designers of the original Unix OS
- Author of the first Unix shell
- Inventor of the B programming language (predecessor to C)
- Basics of how a shell works
- Concepts such as pid, ppid, environment manipulation, etc.

## Requirements üìù
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Use allowed functions and system calls only
- Follow compilation and testing guidelines
